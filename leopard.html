          <h2>THE CEYLON SPOTTED STEALTH</h2>
           <p>The Sri Lankan leopard (Panthera pardus kotiya), native to the island's diverse landscapes, stands as a symbol of both elegance and resilience. This endangered subspecies 
            boasts a distinctive golden coat adorned with striking rosettes, captivating the hearts of those who encounter its elusive presence. With a habitat ranging from lush 
            rainforests to arid scrublands, the Sri Lankan leopard is a vital component of the island's biodiversity, underscoring the need for concerted conservation efforts to secure
             its future in the wild.<BR>
              <br>  The Sri Lankan Leopard can be spotted at : <BR>
                  <LI>Yala National Park:</LI><BR>

Yala National Park, situated in the southeastern part of Sri Lanka, is renowned for hosting a significant population of Sri Lankan leopards. The park encompasses a diverse range of 
ecosystems, including dense jungles, grasslands, and coastal areas. Visitors to Yala have the opportunity to witness leopards in their natural habitat, along with other wildlife such 
as elephants, sloth bears, and various bird species.<BR>

<BR><LI>Wilpattu National Park:</LI><BR>

Located in the northwest of the island, Wilpattu National Park is the largest national park in Sri Lanka. The park's unique feature is its numerous natural lakes, or "villus," and dense
 forests, providing an ideal habitat for leopards. Wilpattu is known for its picturesque landscapes and the chance to spot leopards prowling through the vegetation, making it a popular
  destination for wildlife enthusiasts.<BR>

<BR><LI>Horton Plains National Park:</LI><BR>

Found in the central highlands of Sri Lanka, Horton Plains National Park offers a different setting for leopard sightings. The park is characterized by montane grasslands and cloud 
forests. While the density of leopards might be lower compared to other parks, Horton Plains provides a unique opportunity to observe these elusive cats in a cooler, elevated environment,
 surrounded by stunning vistas including the famous World's End cliff.<BR>

            <h2>POACHING AND ILLEGAL WILDLIFE TRADE</h2>
                <p>Threat Description:<BR> The Sri Lankan leopard faces the threat of poaching driven by demand for its body parts and involvement in the illegal wildlife trade. Leopard
                     skins, bones, and other body parts are sought after for traditional medicine, cultural practices, and the exotic pet trade.<BR>
                   Consequences:<BR> Poaching directly contributes to a decline in leopard populations, disrupting the natural balance of ecosystems. It undermines conservation efforts and
                     poses a serious threat to the genetic diversity and long-term survival of the species.<BR></p>
                   Safety Measures:<br>
                   
                   <li>Stringent Penalties</li> 
                   <li>Anti-Poaching Patrols</li>
                   <li>Population Monitoring</li>

            <h2>HUMAN-WILDLIFE CONFLICT</h2>
                <p>Threat Description:<BR> As human populations expand into leopard habitats, conflicts arise when leopards prey on livestock or, in rare cases, pose a threat to human safety.
                     Retaliatory killings by communities fearing for their livelihoods or safety contribute to a negative cycle of conflict.<BR>
                   Consequences:<BR> Human-leopard conflict results in the loss of both leopard lives and livelihoods for local communities. It disrupts the ecological balance by eliminating
                     a crucial predator and creates a negative perception of leopards, further endangering their existence.<BR>
                   Safety Measures:<br>
                   
                   <li>Early Warning Systems</li>
